# typescript-practice

Simple project where three classes are used.
  1. User
  2. Company
  3. CustomMap

Created a google map class instance where the limit of methods available is one. In this case addMarker. The purpose to limitting the amount of instance methods is to take advantage of OOP and simulate a real-life limitted API.
